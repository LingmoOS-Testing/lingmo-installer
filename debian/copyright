Lingmo-installer was formerly known as "Espresso", and originally as "Lingmo
Express", which is written and maintained by Javier Carranza
<javier.carranza@interactors.coop> and Juanje Ojeda Croissier
<juanje@interactors.coop>. This version draws on the work done on Lingmo
Express, but was renamed to avoid confusion, to reduce awkward branding
considerations, and because Lingmo-installer concentrates on reusing
debian-installer code and reducing duplicated translation and branding work
as much as possible. Lingmo-installer has now substantially diverged from Lingmo
Express and is an independent project.

team for the purposes of a Lingmo derivative focused
upon setting up a standalone MythTV box.
