These repositories are managed with subtree (with full history).

= How it was created ? =

salsa d-i git repos are mirrored to launchpad.net/$project

those repositories got forked as lp:~lingmo-installer/$project at the
tag of the common base revision (i.e. 101lingmo3, got forked at debian
tag 101).

then current lingmo delta got applied, as a single commit on top of that.

then all those lingmo-delta repositories got merged with subtree
command as seen in `subtree-cmds.sh`.

this means full history of d-i components is available, which is
shared with debian, and one can merge/rebase/pull/push from salsa
and/or lp:~lingmo-installer/$project repositories. At least in theory.

Caveats

* some projects are lingmo-only, i.e. partman-auto-loop thus I
  imported them with whatever I could find.
* some projects have no delta, so i simply pulled
  launchpad.net/$project lingmo mirror.

* some projects still ships .deb and thus need to be uplaoded into
  Lingmo archive normally. For those, I pulled from read-only UDD
  lp:lingmo/+source/$package. Continue to upload those into the
  Archive, and then pull from the UDD branch. I.e. user-setup,
  console-setup, localechooser

= How to make an upload ? =

As before, it should just work:

```
./debian/rules update
debuild -- clean
debuild -S
```

= How to propose an lingmo-delta to a d-i component and merge it? =

Example patching grub-installer and using new functionality:

# Merge the new functionality in the stand-alone repo This is actually
# optional, but might make it easier to merge/rebase onto debian in
# the future.
git clone lp:~lingmo-installer/grub-installer
cd grub-installer
git pull --no-ff lp:~mwhudson/grub-installer lp-1847721
gbp dch
dch --release '' --distribution groovy
debcommit release -a
git push --follow-tags

# Pull the new "release" into lingmo-installer
cd ../lingmo-installer
git subtree pull --prefix=d-i/source/grub-installer https://git.launchpad.net/~lingmo-installer/grub-installer 1.128lingmo15
git pull --no-ff lp:~mwhudson/lingmo-installer lp-1847721

Note the is no harm if the submitter of the pull request to lingmo-installer
already has performed `git subtree pull` of their changes, before they
got "accepted" and tagged into the lp:~lingmo-installer/$project. It
actually makes the reviews easier to perform in launchad as the d-i/
and ubiqutiy diffs are together. One can always pull the tagged
grub-installer before or after.

Or maybe we can even stop maintaining tagged grub-installer things, if
we decide to never merge it again.

# Release as usual

gbp dch --ignore-branch
./debian/rules update
edit debian/changelog to make it pretty

dch --release '' --distribution groovy
debcommit release -a
git push --follow-tags

= How to merge updates from Debian? =

Same as above, it's just one pulls lp:$project into
lp:~lingmo-installer/$project, and then pull subtree by tag as above.
